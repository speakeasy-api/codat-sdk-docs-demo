##### `CreatedDate` *{`*string`}*
In Codat's data model, dates and times are represented using the <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601" target="_blank">ISO 8601 standard</a>. Date and time fields are formatted as strings; for example:

```

- Unqualified local time: `2021-11-15T01:00:00`
- UTC time offsets: `2021-11-15T01:00:00-05:00`

> Time zones
> 
> Not all dates from Codat will contain information about time zones.  
> Where it is not available from the underlying platform, Codat will return these as times local to the business whose data has been synced.
