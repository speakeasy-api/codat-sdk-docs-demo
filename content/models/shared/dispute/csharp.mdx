##### *{`string`}* `CreatedDate`
In Codat's data model, dates and times are represented using the <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601" target="_blank">ISO 8601 standard</a>. Date and time fields are formatted as strings; for example:

```
2020-10-08T22:40:50Z
2021-01-01T00:00:00
```



When syncing data that contains `DateTime` fields from Codat, make sure you support the following cases when reading time information:

- Coordinated Universal Time (UTC): `2021-11-15T06:00:00Z`
- Unqualified local time: `2021-11-15T01:00:00`
- UTC time offsets: `2021-11-15T01:00:00-05:00`

> Time zones
> 
> Not all dates from Codat will contain information about time zones.  
> Where it is not available from the underlying platform, Codat will return these as times local to the business whose data has been synced.

##### *{`string`}* `Currency`
The currency data type in Codat is the [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) currency code, e.g. _GBP_.

## Unknown currencies

In line with the ISO 4217 specification, the code _XXX_ is used when the data source does not return a currency for a transaction. 

There are only a very small number of edge cases where this currency code is returned by the Codat system.
