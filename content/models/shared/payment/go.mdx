##### `CreatedDate` *{`*string`}*
In Codat's data model, dates and times are represented using the <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601" target="_blank">ISO 8601 standard</a>. Date and time fields are formatted as strings; for example:

```
2020-10-08T22:40:50Z
2021-01-01T00:00:00
```



When syncing data that contains `DateTime` fields from Codat, make sure you support the following cases when reading time information:

- Coordinated Universal Time (UTC): `2021-11-15T06:00:00Z`
- Unqualified local time: `2021-11-15T01:00:00`
- UTC time offsets: `2021-11-15T01:00:00-05:00`

> Time zones
> 
> Not all dates from Codat will contain information about time zones.  
> Where it is not available from the underlying platform, Codat will return these as times local to the business whose data has been synced.

In line with the ISO 4217 specification, the code _XXX_ is used when the data source does not return a currency for a transaction.
