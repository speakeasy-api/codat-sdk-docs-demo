In Codat's data model, dates and times are represented using the \<a class\="external" href\="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601" target\="_blank"\>ISO 8601 standard\</a\>. Date and time fields are formatted as strings; for example:

```
2020\-10\-08T22:40:50Z
2021\-01\-01T00:00:00
```



When syncing data that contains `DateTime` fields from Codat, make sure you support the following cases when reading time information:

\- Coordinated Universal Time (UTC): `2021\-11\-15T06:00:00Z`
\- Unqualified local time: `2021\-11\-15T01:00:00`
\- UTC time offsets: `2021\-11\-15T01:00:00\-05:00`

\> Time zones
\> 
\> Not all dates from Codat will contain information about time zones.  
\> Where it is not available from the underlying platform, Codat will return these as times local to the business whose data has been synced.
