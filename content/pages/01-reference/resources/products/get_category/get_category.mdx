## Get Category

The *Get product* endpoint returns a single product for a given productId.

[Product categories](https://docs.codat.io/commerce-api#/schemas/ProductCategory) are used to classify a group of products together, either by type (e.g. "Furniture"), or sometimes by tax profile.

Check out our [coverage explorer](https://knowledge.codat.io/supported-features/commerce?view=tab-by-data-type&dataType=commerce-productCategories) for integrations that support getting a specific product.

Before using this endpoint, you must have [retrieved data for the company](https://docs.codat.io/codat-api#/operations/refresh-company-data).
