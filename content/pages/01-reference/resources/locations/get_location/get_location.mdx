## Get Location

The *Get location* endpoint returns a single location for a given locationId.

[Locations](https://docs.codat.io/commerce-api#/schemas/Location) hold information on the geographic location at which stocks of [products](https://docs.codat.io/commerce-api#/schemas/Product) may be held or where [orders](https://docs.codat.io/commerce-api#/schemas/Order) were placed.

Check out our [coverage explorer](https://knowledge.codat.io/supported-features/commerce?view=tab-by-data-type&dataType=commerce-locations) for integrations that support getting a specific location.

Before using this endpoint, you must have [retrieved data for the company](https://docs.codat.io/codat-api#/operations/refresh-company-data).
