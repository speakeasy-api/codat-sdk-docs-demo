The *Get payment* endpoint returns a single payment for a given paymentId.

[Payments](https://docs.codat.io/commerce-api#/schemas/Payment) contain details of all payments made by customers to the company.

Check out our [coverage explorer](https://knowledge.codat.io/supported-features/commerce?view=tab-by-data-type&dataType=commerce-payments) for integrations that support getting a specific payment.

Before using this endpoint, you must have [retrieved data for the company](https://docs.codat.io/codat-api#/operations/refresh-company-data).
